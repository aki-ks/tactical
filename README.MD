# Tactical

This project aims to simplify working with JVM bytecode.

Building a referenced based intermediation for java bytecode is the main objective.

# Stack
- The `stack` intermediation represents bytecode close to JVM bytecode.
- Instructions that serve the sole purpose of saving diskspace have been removed.
  E.g. `bipush`, `sipush`, `ldc`, `ldc2`, `iconst_0`, `iconst_1` and many more are all represented by the `PushInsn`.
- `long` and `double` values require only one slot on the stack.
  The DUP2 instruction for instance does always duplicate two values.
  In JVM bytecode it may duplicate either one or two values depending on their type.
- Dead code will be dropped during the conversion

# Ref
- The `ref` intermediation drops the concept of operating on a stack and uses references instead.
- Instructions have been replaced against the concept of statements and expressions.
- The instruction set was thereby further reduced.
- It is a statically typed language - locals have types.
- Dead code will be dropped. Local variable debug information get lost during conversion from stack to ref.

# Objectives
