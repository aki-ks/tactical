/**
 * This postprocessor detects uses of locals that are independent from each other.
 * These locals will then get split into as many locals as possible.
 * This is necessary since one local might otherwise have different types at different locations within the code.
 *
 * Here's pseudocode for one example local that would get split:
 * <pre><code>
 *     local x;
 *
 *     // Block 1
 *     if (...) {
 *         x = 10;
 *     } else {
 *         x = 30;
 *     }
 *     System.out.println(x);
 *
 *     // Block 2
 *     if (...) {
 *         x = "a";
 *     } else {
 *         x = "b";
 *     }
 *     System.out.println(x);
 * </code></pre>
 *
 * First the local <tt>x</tt> is an <tt>int</tt>, then it is a <tt>String</tt>.
 * That makes assigning a type to <tt>x</tt> impossible.
 *
 * Since it is not possible to access values assigned to <tt>x</tt> by the first block from the second block,
 * all uses of <tt>x</tt> in the second block can be replaced against a new variable.
